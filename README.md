Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Stock market prediction and forecasting using stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a common approach in the field of financial forecasting. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on past trends and patterns in the stock market data.To train the model, historical stock market data is first preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. The data is normalized to ensure that all features are on the same scale, and windowing is used to create sequences of input data and output labels.
